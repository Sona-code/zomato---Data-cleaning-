Title: Zomato Dataset - Data Cleaning

Description:

The Zomato dataset is a comprehensive collection of restaurant data from the popular online food delivery platform Zomato. This dataset contains detailed information about restaurants, including their names, cuisines, locations, ratings, and more.

This repository focuses on the data cleaning process applied to the Zomato dataset. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis workflow that involves transforming and preparing the raw data for further analysis or modeling.

In this project, I have performed various data cleaning tasks on the Zomato dataset, including:

Handling Missing Values: Addressing missing data by either imputing reasonable values or making informed decisions on how to handle missing entries.

Removing Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate records to ensure data integrity and avoid redundancy in the dataset.

By sharing this cleaned version of the Zomato dataset, we aim to provide a high-quality and reliable resource for researchers, analysts, and data enthusiasts interested in exploring and analyzing restaurant data.

Please note that this repository only focuses on the data cleaning aspect, and further analysis or modeling can be performed on the cleaned dataset.

Feel free to explore the cleaned Zomato dataset and leverage it for various data analysis tasks, restaurant recommendations, sentiment analysis, or any other related research.
